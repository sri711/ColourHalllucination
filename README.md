We implement the paper -"Colorful Image Colorization" by Richard Zhang, Phillip Isola, and Alexei A. Efros
The authors propose a deep learning-based approach that significantly improves the colorization process, producing more realistic and diverse color results.
The VGG-based architecture used in the paper is designed to leverage deep learning's strengths in feature extraction and generation, allowing for high-quality colorization of grayscale images.
